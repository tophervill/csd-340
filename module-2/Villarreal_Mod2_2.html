        <h2>Chapter 2 : About Me</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Christopher Villarreal, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Development. For as long as I could remember, I have always been fascinated by technology and how software can solve real-world problems. This passion has driven me to further my education and skills in this field.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Southern California, and I've lived around a busy city environment most of my life. Being around so many different people and places has helped me stay open-minded and adaptable. I like learning skills that feel practical, because I want to build things people can actually use.</p>

        <p>Aside from the obvious of enjoying technology, I also have interest in things like aquariums, anime, and music! I have two aquariums at home, one is a 5-gallon and the other is a 10-gallon, which both house Neocaridina Cherry Shrimps. <span class="sentence">I am currently watching the latest season of Jujutsu Kaisen, which is one of my favorite anime series at the moment.</span></p>

        <p>Overall, I'm someone who values learning at my own pace and always choosing to be hands on. I tend to enjoy activities where I can see progress over time, whether that's improving a skill or maintaining a routine. Taking things step by step helps me stay focused and motivated, especially when balancing school, work, and a personal life.</p>
